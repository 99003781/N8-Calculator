# Requirements
## Introduction

The Research has been divided on the basis of cost and features of different calculators. 

## Research
The price ranges from Rs 100-300 which can be used by students in school & in universities, scientist and scholars. This device includes a large range of features at lower cost. The features include basic arithmetic operations,BMI calculation,conversion of Numeric into binary, octal,hexa decimal and vice versa. It can also perform basic trigonometry calculations.It includes nth root and power of n calculating features. Another category includes Body mass index(BMI) feature , calculation of trigonometric functions including exponential, logarithms and number conversion. The features can  be enhanced further but at the cost will  increase accordingly. At a range of Rs 600-650, complex calculations and imaginary numbers can be included. Calculators having medium costs are having medium set of features which includes matrix and calculus. Higher features at medium cost of price includes binary conversions and are foldables. Calculators of higher prices includes the functions of database management, higher accuracy,wider display for plots and graphs. It also includes smart touch, solar cell operations, battery charging and a waterproof.

## Cost and Features
The price range of calculator is from 100 to 1000
