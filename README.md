## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Found difficulty in writing the make file but with the help of collegues we are able to make our own make file
2. Initially it was difficult to understand the functions in test cases, but with self and group study we resolved the problems
3. Code debugging was a bit time consuming, but with brainstorming we excel it.
4. Integration of individual codes was difficult to understand, but with peer support, we did it.
